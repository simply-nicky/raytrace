# raytrace-project
X-rays ray-tracing computer simulation on concave surfaces.

## features:

- 2D ray-tracing on cyllindrical surfaces
- 3D ray-tracing on spherical surfaces
- 3D ray-tracing on spherical surfaces with surface defects. Surface defects are modelled with spheres.

## yet to be done:

- 3D ray-tracing on elliptical surfaces
